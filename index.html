		<p> I'm a pretty fine guy. You have to ask more, I can't give you the whole spill.
            I'm an MIS Major in Ashesi University.
            I'll graduate in 2022. The year Black Panther 2 was supposed to be released.
            I like giving relationship advice, though I've never had a girlfriend. Coaches don't play.
            I draw a lot too. I'm pretty good.
            I'm from Big Ada in the Greater Accra Region.
            Yeah.
