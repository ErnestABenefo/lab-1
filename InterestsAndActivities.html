            I am a huge fan of digital art. I have a soft spot for comics.

        <p>
            The science of film scoring and other genres of music in movies 
            has been a fascinating area of study for me.

        <p> VIsual effects in film and game development is another area of
            fascination for me. Unlike film scoring and digital art however,
            this field is the one I have paid least attention to in recent years,
            in terms of practice. With theoretical knowledge however, I'm like 
            a Samurai.
            Just as one who studies the blade, I have studied ivsual effects.
            ALthough I've never
            held the blade
