           In Freshman year, I created an application which simplified emergency calls.
           At the tap of a button, the police, fire service, personal security and family
           would hear your distress and receive your loaction via SMS.

           I also created a spftware that used basic information of various student businesses
           to suggest which choices they made in terms of marketting strategies.

            In second year, I worked with 4 brilliant minds to create a software 
            that kept track of galamsey activities.
